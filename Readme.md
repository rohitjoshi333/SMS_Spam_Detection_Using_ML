# SMS Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the initial setup and documentation for an Artificial Intelligence coursework project focused on SMS spam detection using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a supervised machine learning system that can automatically classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** (legitimate messages). The project applies classical machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to identify unwanted messages based on textual patterns.

## Problem Domain
With the increasing use of mobile communication, spam messages have become a common issue. These messages often contain advertisements, phishing links, or fraudulent content. Manual filtering is inefficient, making automated spam detection a practical and necessary solution.

## Dataset
The project uses an SMS spam dataset obtained from GeeksforGeeks, which contains labeled SMS messages for supervised classification. The dataset includes real-world messages categorized as spam or ham.

## Machine Learning Approach
This project focuses on supervised classification using the following algorithms:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

Text data will be converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization before training the models.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model will be evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Project Status
This repository currently contains only project documentation. Source code, experiments, and results will be added in later stages as the project progresses.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
